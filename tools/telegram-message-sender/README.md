# Telegram Bot Message Sender Tool for Open WebUI

## **What's New?**

The Telegram Bot Message Sender Tool allows you to send messages directly to a specified Telegram user through a bot. This simple tool integrates seamlessly with Open WebUI, making it easy to send automated messages, alerts, or notifications.

### **Effortless Message Sending**

With the `send_message` function, sending messages to a Telegram user has never been easier. Simply provide the message content, configure the bot token and chat ID, and let the tool handle the message delivery. Whether you're automating notifications or alerts, the tool will ensure your messages reach the intended recipient.

### **Proxy Support**

For added flexibility, the tool supports optional proxy usage. If you need to route your requests through a specific proxy server, you can configure it in the settings.

### **Why?**

The Telegram Bot Message Sender Tool was developed to fill the need for a reliable and straightforward solution to send messages to Telegram users automatically. After recognizing this gap, the tool was created with ease of integration and flexibility in mind. Now, with the ability to configure both bot tokens, chat IDs, and optional proxy settings, it’s ready for real-world use in various applications.

### **How to Use**

Getting started with the Telegram Bot Message Sender Tool is quick and simple. Here’s how to make the most of it:

- **Sending a Message**: To send messages to a Telegram user,tell the LLM to do so, then LLM invokes the `send_message` function. Passes the desired message content as an argument to the function, Then the message will be sent directly to the configured Telegram user.

- **Configuring the Bot**: Set the `BOT_TOKEN` and `CHAT_ID` values to configure the bot, as well as the optional `PROXY` setting to ensure messages are routed correctly.
