# Memory Enhancement Tool for Open WebUI - MET

## **What's New?**

Join us on this exciting journey of memory enhancement for Open WebUI equipped with our innovative `MemoriesTable` feature. This feature, accessible in the Settings / Personalization section, offers an efficient upgrade in memory management, ensuring that your Open WebUI tools remain top-notch with privacy at the forefront.

### **Improved Memory Handling**

The `MemoriesTable` class presents an array of seamless functionalities. Enhancing your memory management efforts with ease, it allows for straightforward tasks such as insertion, retrieval, and update operations. Effortlessly navigate through your memories, ensuring they are always fresh and relevant.

### **Consistent Updates and Smooth Accessibility**

Take a stroll down memory lane with recall, a function designed to bring back memories instantly. From asking "what are our memories" to uncovering the answer through the memories vault, the retrieval process is effortless and accurate, exactly as you remember it.

### **Why the Change?**

As we explore the realm of memory management with our previous approach, we've uncovered a realm of improvements that promise a smoother and more efficient experience for all users. Built with cutting-edge techniques, we aim to expand performance, scalability, and refine the overall interaction with Open WebUI.

Huge thanks to [dnl13](https://github.com/dnl13) for sparking the innovative conversations that formed the backbone of these enhancements. 

Additionally, special thanks to [CookSleep](https://openwebui.com/t/cooksleep/memory) for their contributions in adding the functionalities of updating and deleting memories in this tool.

I recently came across a fork of this tool by **[CookSleep](https://openwebui.com/t/cooksleep/memory)**, and after reviewing their work, I realized that integrating their new methods would make our tool even more complete. Their efforts in adding memory update and delete functionalities offer a meaningful enhancement, and I believe incorporating these features would not only improve the tool but also bring greater value to the community.

Their work has played a significant role in making this tool more robust and user-friendly.


### **How to Use**

Unlock the potential of your memories by integrating our user-friendly functions:

- **Recalling Memories**: Uncover your past with the `recall_memories` function or engage with generic prompts such as "what are our memories?" or "who am I?" allowing the system to draw from the memories vault in a personalized manner.

- **Adding Memories**: Safeguard your thoughts through our `add_memory` functionality. Add textual content or keep the process automated by letting it decide when to pick up new entries. Remembering is now made easier â€“ akin to jotting your thoughts down in a digital diary!

- **Updating Memories**: Easily update any stored memories with the `update_memory` function. Keep your memories accurate and fresh by editing them whenever necessary.

- **Deleting Memories**: Remove memories you no longer need or want by using the `delete_memory` function. Clean up your memory vault for better organization.
