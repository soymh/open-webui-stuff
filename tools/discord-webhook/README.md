# Discord Webhook Tool for Open WebUI

## **What's New?**

The Discord Webhook Tool allows you to send messages directly to a specified Discord channel using a webhook. This simple tool integrates seamlessly with Open WebUI, making it easier than ever to automate notifications, alerts, or messages.

### **Effortless Message Sending**

With the `send_message` function, sending messages to a Discord channel has never been more straightforward. Simply provide the message content, configure the webhook URL, and let the tool do the rest. Whether you're automating alerts or notifications, the webhook will take care of delivering the message.

### **Proxy Support**

For added security and customization, the tool also supports optional proxy usage. If you need to route your requests through a specific proxy server, you can easily configure it in the settings.

### **Why ?**

After developing and testing the tool, we identified the need for a reliable and simple solution to send messages to Discord channels automatically. This tool was born from that need, and its goal is to simplify the integration between Open WebUI and Discord. Now, with the ability to configure both webhook URLs and optional proxy settings, the tool is ready for real-world use and useful enough for various applications.

### **How to Use**

Getting started with the Discord Webhook Tool is quick and easy. Hereâ€™s how to make the most of it:

- **Sending a Message**: Tell the LLM to send messages to the discord channel, and then it uses the `send_message` function to send a message to a Discord channel. Pass the desired message content as an argument to the function.

- **Configuring the Webhook**: Set the `WEBHOOK_URL` and optionally a `PROXY` in the tool to ensure messages are routed properly.
