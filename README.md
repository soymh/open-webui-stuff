# Memory Enhancement Tool(in short : MET) for Open WebUI

Welcome to the Memory Enhancement Tool for Open WebUI! This tool is all about enhancing memory management capabilities within Open WebUI. If you're wondering why we decided to make some big changes in this branch, let me walk you through it.

## What's New?

We've switched things up a bit by incorporating the amazing `MemoriesTable` class. Why? Well, we've discovered a fresh and efficient way to handle memories in Open WebUI, by a demo feature called MemoriesTable which is accessible in Settings/Personaliztion. This new implementation aligns perfectly with the modern-day needs of memory management, ensuring your tools remain top-notch and memories are safe!

1. **Improved Memory Handling**: The `MemoriesTable` class allows us to handle memory entries more effectively. It's designed to manage memory out of the box, providing functionalities for insertion, retrieval, and update with ease. 
   
2. **Consistent Updates**: The memory system now ensures your memories are always up to date and organized. No more worries about outdated information cluttering your memory vault!

3. **Effortless Retrieval**: Need to take a trip down memory lane? We've got you covered. With the new system, recalling memories is straightforward and precise — everything presented just as you've stored it!

## Why the Change?

Our previous approach was doing well (at least on the gpt-4o api tests; videos would be accessible soon), but we believe there’s always room for improvement. By embracing this new structure, we can achieve better performance, scalability, and make the experience of using Open WebUI even smoother.

Plus, we wanted to thank our insightful contributor, [dnl13](https://github.com/dnl13), for the thoughtful recommendations that led to these improvements. Great ideas come from collaboration, and we're grateful to have such a supportive community!

## How To Use

Using the tool is as simple as ever. Here’s a quick guide:

- **Recalling Memories**: Retrieve all your stored memories quickly and easily with the `recall_memories` function; tell the LLM "what are our memories" or "who am I" to give you the answer based on the memories vault! Just like flipping through a photo album!

- **Adding Memories**: Add new memories anytime with the `add_memory` function.tell it to add one or its ownself will decide when to add one! It's like jotting down a thought in your digital diary — safe and secure.
## Contribute
