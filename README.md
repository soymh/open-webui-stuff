# Open WebUI Stuff

Welcome to the **Open WebUI Stuff** repository! This is a dedicated space for sharing tools, prompts, and explanations related to open WebUI projects.

## Overview

This repository was initially created to demonstrate the usage of GPT-4 memory mimic tools within Open WebUI. However, I decided to expand its purpose to serve as a comprehensive storage for various Open WebUI resources.

### Demo

Check out the demo of the GPT-4 memory mimic tool below! Please note that this is still in the demo release phase and has a long way to go. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!
